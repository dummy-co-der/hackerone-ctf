## Step 3 : FLAG

You can see two options displaying as `resources` and `sources`. Go to on `resources`. Click on `AndroidManifest.xml`. We will see the location and the name of the android apk.

Now we have to do look for file in `com -> hacker101 ->  level11` as  `ThermostatActivity.jav`a to get the flags.

Going through the code we saw the file `ThermostatActivity.java` is connected to `PayloadRequest.java` I just go back and click on the file.

Opening the file and scrolling it down, got  flag 1 and in the same file scrolling it a bit more you can see flag 2.
